The Corona crisis has shown us how vulnerable we all are. Sticking together has never been more important, especially in an industry like ours, which is dominated by fixed-term contracts and competition. Many film crews are experiencing what can be achieved when we stand up together. Others feel left alone and don't know what to do in the coming weeks and months.

Unfortunately, the current crisis also gives us a glimpse into our future unless we soon decide to tackle the issue of environmental protection just as consistently and purposefully.

1. With the current warming, many regions are already facing more frequent and more severe extreme weather events and their consequences such as heat waves, droughts, forest fires and heavy rainfall.
2. The effects of global warming are also a threat to human health. In addition to the direct consequences, indirect consequences of global warming such as food insecurity and the spread of pathogens must also be taken into account.
3. If the international community fails to meet the 1.5°C limit on global warming set by the Paris Convention, considerably greater climate impacts on humans and nature can be expected in many regions of the world.
4. In order not to exceed a warming of 1.5°C, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced very rapidly and, in particular, net emissions of CO2 must be reduced to zero worldwide over the next 20 to 30 years
5. Instead, CO2 emissions continue to rise. With the proposals currently on the table around the world, global warming is likely to exceed 3°C by the end of the century and then increase further due to persistent emissions and feedback effects.
6. At current emissions, the remaining global CO2 emissions budget for the 1.5 degree path will only last for about 10 years. For the 2-degree path it is also only enough for about 25-30 years.

Less traffic, hardly any flights, shut-down industries... With a little "luck", the current measures to restrict public life will even enable some countries to achieve their climate targets for 2020. Unfortunately, this is not a reason to celebrate. If we continue to do the same afterwards, it will most likely have catastrophic consequences for us and especially for future generations.

The current crisis must therefore become a time of change. We need to start working now and commit ourselves to a socially and environmentally sustainable future. 
Our industry has quite a few issues. Diesel generators, trucks and fleets of vehicles, disposable tableware, construction materials and props, our costumes and what happens to everything afterwards. The list is almost endless.

##### Our objectives are simply summed up in three points
1. Minimizing the environmental impact of our industry while maintaining socially acceptable working conditions
2. Sustainable storytelling, i.e. what ideals do we convey and what stories do we tell
3. Raising awareness of the crew and the public

To archive this we need you! Look around on our website and join us! A good start is a signature of our joint statement, which deals with our social responsibility. After that, we will have to work out strategies to make our industry fit for the future in a sustainable way and thus continue to tell our great stories, which are also needed for such a change.
