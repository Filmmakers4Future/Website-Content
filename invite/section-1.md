## How to use the tool
1. Enter the email addresses of the people you want to invite
2. Adapt our template to your wishes
	* Please note that each person receives the same mail, so a personal greeting is not possible if there are several recipients
3. Open the mail in your default mail program
	* If you do not have an email program on your phone/computer, you can use the second button to copy the mail and addresses to the clipboard and paste them into a new email on the website of your email provider.
	* Make sure to insert the addresses in the field for blind copy (bcc) so that your recipients will only see their own mail address. 
4. You can add more mail addresses from your address book in your email program before you send the invitation.
5. Send the mail using your email program or the website of your email provider.
