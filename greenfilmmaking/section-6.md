### Improve your office

A good deal of film production takes place in offices. From coming up with ideas in one's home office to the development and financing by producers, as well as the similarly office-based production process. As such, pan-industry topics such as green offices in sustainable buildings are hugely important in our industry as well.

Some of the things you should think about are:
* Electricity and heating from renewable energies
* Mechanical cooling and sun protection
* Drinkable tap water
* Waste separation
* Multifunctional & writable walls
* Flexible furnishings & low-emission interior design

Then check which purchases you can make in a sustainable way - used, fair trade, environmentally friendly. Which work processes can be optimized with regard to their resource and financial efficiency (e.g. printing on both sides of recycled paper) on the one hand and with regard to employee satisfaction (e.g. ergonomics, exercise, catering) on the other.
