### Waste separation

Enable waste separation by providing multiple types of bins according to local standards. They should be clearly labeled and available at various locations on set. Having only one type of bin makes it harder to recycle and to properly dispose of non-recyclable materials.

**Even more importantly:** Make your crew aware of how to avoid garbage and support them in the process.
