### Have people opt-in for printed call sheets

Let's assume your production has **60 crew members**. Your typical call sheet may be around **3 pages**. For a **35 days production** this sums up to **6.300 pages** of paper or roughly **31kg** (68lb). For a **200 people crew** and **55 shooting days** this already increases to **33.000 pages** and **165kg** (364lb) of paper. If you also print risk assessments and other extra information these numbers can quickly double while being easily avoidable.

Instead of printing all those pages let your crew know why you decided against it and give them an option to opt-in - **instead of out** - if their position requires a physically printed version.
