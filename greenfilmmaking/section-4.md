### Eliminate idling of cars and generators

In the US over 14 million liters (3.8 million gallons) of fuel are wasted everday by idling. You should therefore enforce a strict no idling policy for your production. Use vehicles with automatic start/stop systems, turn off unused generators and replace those that are oversized for the current load. Whenever possible, favor the local power grid over a generator for electricity.
