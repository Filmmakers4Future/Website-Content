### Educate your crew and team members - inspire them to talk about it

When it comes to this issue it is vital that everyone is on board. Start conversations about how to be greener, incorporate the topic into your daily safety meetings and help people realize the importance of treating our planet better. It does not help if you are fully aware of this but your team is not. So inspire them to come up with their own ideas and when they do support them. Ideally, appoint a responsible person to whom people can turn in matters concerning climate protection. The goal must be that every member of your team thinks about the ecological consequences of their actions and knows how important it is to do the right thing.
