### Make use of organic regional and seasonal foods - reduce meat

Regional and seasonal foods have many advantages. They do not have to be transported over long distances and thus save a lot of COâ‚‚, which would otherwise be released during transport. They support local agriculture and are fresher because they do not have to be harvested prematurely and instead end up directly in the hands of the consumer without much detour. This often makes them tastier and healthier as well.

Way too often the vegetarian and vegan menu feel like a second-class option. It's the same dish, but the meat has been replaced by tofu, for instance. Meatless dishes can be very nutritious, healthy and incredibly delicious. If the vegetarian dish is regarded as an independent and first-class option by the catering provider, one quickly notices that even non-vegetarians increasingly choose it, even if meat is offered as well. Once you have arrived at this point, you can completely omit meat on individual days without any major complaints. Especially if you simultaneously educate your crew about the reasons behind this decision.
