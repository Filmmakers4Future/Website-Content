## Language and Terminology

For now please refere to **[Terminology, Power and Oppressive Language](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html)**. 

#### Repositories in our GitHub organization

The default branch of our repositories is called `main`. 

>  `Master-slave`  is an oppressive metaphor that will and should never become fully detached from history. [^1] 

Even though there technically is no `master-slave` relationship in a git repository, the word can still be understood in this context and since `main` is just as good a description for our purposes, we decided to name it that way hoping people will feel more confortable this way. 

In case it bothers no one, it will at least encourage reflection on some established technical terms & metaphors and their roots.
