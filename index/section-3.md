## Our core believes
<hr class="divider light my-4">

We see ourselves as intersectional environmentalists and believe this to be the only way forward.

##### What Is Intersectional Environmentalism? 
This is an inclusive version of environmentalism that advocates for both the protection of people and the planet.  
It identifies the ways in which injustices happening to marginalized communities and the earth are interconnected.  
It brings injustices done to vulnerable communities, and the earth, to the forefront and does not minimize or silence social inequality.  
**Intersectional environmentalism advocates for justice for people and the planet.**
