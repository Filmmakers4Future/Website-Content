## 4. Data processing by third party providers

### 4.1. Videos on our video page

The videos displayed on our [videos page](/videos) are hosted by third party services (YouTube and Vimeo). When playing one of those videos, a connection to their server is established.

This will only happen **after and when you decide to click** on one of the preview images on our [videos page](/videos).

When you do the video provider will be told on which page you are watching the video from. In this way - if you are logged into your YouTube or Vimeo account - YouTube and Vimeo can personally assign your surfing behavior to you. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube and Vimeo account beforehand. If you want you can also right click on the images to copy the link to the video and manually open it in a new tab. This way YouTube and Vimeo won't know which page you are coming from. If a video is started, the providers use cookies that collect information about user behavior. Whoever has deactivated the saving of cookies for the Google Ads program will not have to reckon with such cookies when watching YouTube videos. However, YouTube and Vimeo also stores non-personal usage information in other cookies. If you wish to prevent this, you must block the storage of cookies in your browser. YouTube and Vimeo also obtains your IP address when watching a video.
