## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (online and offline), and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

Additional guidelines regarding contributing to our code on GitHub, can be found [here](/coding-guidelines/). Please review them before contributing.

We may in extreme cases also decide to exclude people from the community because of behaviour that occurred outside the community.
