## Enforcement Responsibilities

Our Code of Conduct Committee is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

The committee has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
posts, comments, signatures, code commits, wiki edits, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.
