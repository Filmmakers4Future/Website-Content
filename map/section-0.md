## How to use the map
#### Locate your city
In order to find companies, events & initiatives related to green film production simply locate your city on the map below and start exploring!  

###### Here are some examples you can try:
* <a href="#map" onclick="document.getElementById('if_kvm').src = 'https://kartevonmorgen.org/#/?center=52.503,13.293&zoom=11.00&search=%23filmmakers4future';">Berlin</a>
* <a href="#map" onclick="document.getElementById('if_kvm').src = 'https://kartevonmorgen.org/#/?center=51.514,-0.397&zoom=10.00&search=%23filmmakers4future';">London</a>
* <a href="#map" onclick="document.getElementById('if_kvm').src = 'https://kartevonmorgen.org/#/?center=33.948,-118.393&zoom=10.00&search=%23filmmakers4future';">Los Angeles</a>

#### Using tags
Production related searches should always start with the tag ***#filmmakers4future***.  
To narrow down your search you can add additional tags afterwards for example ***<a href="#map" onclick="document.getElementById('if_kvm').src = 'https://kartevonmorgen.org/#/?search=%23filmmakers4future%20%23rental';">#rental</a>*** (click on the tag to try).  
To make your search even more specific simply add some more tags like ***<a href="#map" onclick="document.getElementById('if_kvm').src = 'https://kartevonmorgen.org/#/?search=%23filmmakers4future%20%23rental%20%23light';">#light</a>***.

#### Add new entries to the map
We invite and encourage you to add any company, event or initiative that helps our industry produce in an environmentally friendly way.  

**You do not need an account to edit or add new entries, we will however monitor all submissions.**  

If possible briefly describe what the entity you add does and how it can help productions be more sustainable.  
Be sure to add specific and more common tags as shown in the example above, so others can easily find your entry.
