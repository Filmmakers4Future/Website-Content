## How to use the map
#### Locate your city
In order to find companies, events & initiatives related to green film production simply locate your city on the map below and start exploring!  
Please note that some companies are located within a city, but can also be useful outside of it. For example rental, electricity or transportation companies.

#### Using tags
Production related searches should always start with the tag ***#greenfilm***.  
Let's say we want to find a camera rental: 
1. To hide all non-rental entries add the tag ***#rental***.  
3. To make your search even more specific simply add some more tags in this case ***#camera***.  
4. Entities that have signed our statement have the tag ***#filmmakers4future***.

You can also use the shortcuts above the map and then add more tags to manually narrow your search.
