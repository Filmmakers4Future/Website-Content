The data collected during the ticketing process that can be associated with you will be stored for a maximum of 60 days after the event. Once this period has expired, all data that we are not legally required to retain (e.g. invoicing data for reasons of financial auditability (Art. 17 (3)b GDPR)) will be deleted. Data that you have provided in the context of a survey while booking your ticket may be stored indefinitely in an anonymized form that cannot be linked back to you.
