We, **Filmmakers for Future**, endorse the 10-point call for intersectional climate justice by [**Fridays for Future**](https://fridaysforfuture.org/september24) and will strike alongside them on **24th September 2021**.

We demand the governments of the world to stop ignoring the predictions of the scientific community and to ambitiously protect the future generations of humankind through concrete **socially just and inclusive measures**!

We call on all film funding agencies, producers, policy and decision-makers, film crews, actresses and actors to **strictly adhere to sustainable production practices**, to issue and adopt their own policies based on the latest scientific research and publications - such as the third leaked [IPPC report](https://scientistrebellion.com/we-leaked-the-upcoming-ipcc-report) - and to use and distribute financial resources specifically for projects that are in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement and **limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C**.
