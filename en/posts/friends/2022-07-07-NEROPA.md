**The World is diverse & colourful and one half are women**

Overall however, films and television have not been reflecting this reality.  

Films and programmes, fictional and non-fictional, are characterized by a strong male majority onscreen. Whether itâ€™s talk shows, sports or feature films, the focus is mostly on men: men talk and women listen, men act and women look nice.  
  

**NEROPA** was developed by **Belinde Ruth Stieve** as a method to increase the proportion of women and encourage diversity in film projects onscreen and to sensitize and raise awareness among those involved.

## Don't stop just yet...

The world is even more colorful than women and men. Please use this technique for all kind of diversity!
