#### About the series
Green shooting? Exactly what is that? We've all heard of it, but few of us have actually tried it.  
**Filmmakers for Future** invites professionals with experience in various trades to tell us first-hand exactly how "green filmmaking" works in their field.
In conversations that you can follow from the comfort of your couch, knowledge will be made accessible. Of course you can also ask questions!  

Green filmmaking is a challenge we all face, but above all it is an opportunity to take change into our own hands.  
With this series of talks, we want to show you what can be done and encourage you to take your learnings with you into your everyday working life.

#### Language
This first season of talks (including this one) will be held in German. However, future ones in English are expected to follow.
