The **Sustainable Production Forum (SPF)** will take place virtually this year due to covid-19.  
Although this is a bit of a loss, it does have one major advantage: People from all over the world will be able to participate much easier!
Since Filmmakers for Future will also be joining a panel this year, we would like to invite you to this event.

#### About the event
The **Sustainable Production Forum (SPF)** focuses on the pressing issue of sustainability within the motion picture and entertainment industry. Evidence has shown that this industry is a contributor to our global environmental footprint and that motion picture and entertainment must shift to continue business as usual. The SPF was imagined as a pathway to discuss and highlight the challenges and create open dialogue to define solutions which work towards a vision for sustainable film-making. 

SPF is an annual event that takes place over two days. It is a one of a kind event that brings together members from across the motion picture industry as well as sustainability experts and enthusiasts alike.
