		<p>Born in Bari (Italy) in 1979, <b>Adriano Grilli</b> moves to Bologna at 19, where he earns a degree in <b>Film Studies</b> and expands his passion for filmmaking.</p>
		
		<p>From 2005 he allows himself to be drawn into the maelstrom of <b>light design</b> and its manifold facets.
			In 2009, he moves on to northern Germany, where on-set practice and a constant thirst for knowledge continue to accompany him.</p>
		<p>Over the years, he completes further training to become a <b>Master of Event Technology</b> <small>(Meister f端r Veranstaltungstechnik - FR Beleuchtung)</small> as well as several additional qualifications.</p>
		
		<p>Since 2018 he is <b>board member of the Federal Association for Lighting and Grip in Germany</b> <small>(Bundesverbandes f端r Beleuchtung und Kamerab端hne e.V.)</small>.</p>
		
		<p>The love for film lighting was joined by an enthusiasm for didactics: this was followed by teaching positions, among others, for the <b>Hamburg Media School</b> and for the <b>Hochschule f端r Medien Stuttgart.</b></p>
		
		<p>For family, work and the cat, he disregards boredom: for his birthday he wishes for a few days with 25 hours, but not a single day with fewer plans.</p>

#### About the series
Green shooting? Exactly what is that? We've all heard of it, but few of us have actually tried it.  
**Filmmakers for Future** invites professionals with experience in various trades to tell us first-hand exactly how "green filmmaking" works in their field.
In conversations that you can follow from the comfort of your couch, knowledge will be made accessible. Of course you can also ask questions!  

Green filmmaking is a challenge we all face, but above all it is an opportunity to take change into our own hands.  
With this series of talks, we want to show you what can be done and encourage you to take your learnings with you into your everyday working life.

#### Language
This first season of talks (including this one) will be held in German. However, future ones in English are expected to follow.
