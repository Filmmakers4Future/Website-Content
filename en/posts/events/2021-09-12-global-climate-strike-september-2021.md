The global climate justice movement has announced a global climate strike for the end of September. Filmmakers for Future is calling on every single one, especially from the film industry to join the **STRIKE** on Friday, **24th September 2021** in your city!

-   Find your local strike: [FFF Strike Map](https://map.fridaysforfuture.org/map?c=+All+countries&d=2021-09-24+next+DEEP+GLOBAL&o=all "Fridays for Future strike map")

If for whatever reason you can’t strike in person we'd like to encourage you to take part with some alternative actions:
- Striking indoors with a sign and posting it on social media using a hashtag like #filmstrike4climate #fm4f #FridaysForFuture #UproottheSystem #Climatestrikeonline #Digitalstrike.
- If you are on set, grab some crew, actresses and actors, take a strike picture and send it to [wolfgang@filmmakersforfuture.org](mailto:wolfgang@filmmakersforfuture.org "send an email to Wolfgang"). We will post it on our Instagram page, if you like to be tagged please include your instagram name.

**Notice:** When posting on social media yourself please use the tags above and mention [@filmmakers4future](https://www.instagram.com/filmmakers4future/).

Join us on the street!

#### BERLIN

You can join us in Berlin at 12pm next to the German Bundestag.  
We will be walking together with other *for future groups* in one big block.

Stickers are available to pick up at the strike in Berlin or can be requested in advance for delivery.  
You can print the logo file yourself as well, which is [available here](https://filmmakersforfuture.org/en/graphics/).
