## Adjust the mindset towards protecting the environment

While talking to people on set we realized that the different departments quite often have very good ideas on how to improve the sustainability of a production. Sadly most of the time they are encouraged to go the environmentally harmful route by their superiors because it seems cheaper, less complicated or has always been done that way. Harmful actions are also done out of pure routine and not giving it another thought. Like using a 140 KVA gasoline generator to charge some batteries instead of asking the restaurant nearby for a socket. Doing that would not only be a lot cheaper but also much better for our planet. The main purpose of the public signature list therefore is to increase the pressure on productions to rethink, and instead of the simple route, always follow the one best for the environment. It also allows us to see who we can join forces with, to make a production rethink their position.
